# Solving-a-randomly-generated-maze
Using path finding algorithms to find a path between two points on a randomly generated maze.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. A maze is randomly generated with only black and white pixels. The probability of a pixel of being black is maintained as 30%.
2. BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, Greedy BFS and A* --- these five path finding algorithm is used to find path between the top-left and bottom-right corner pixel.
